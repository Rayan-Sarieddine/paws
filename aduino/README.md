I. Objective of the experiment
The objective of this experiment is to build a pet tracker that locates the pet's location through gps coordinates and sends the Longitude and Latitude to the backend to be stored in the database table "trackers"

II. Equipment used with role of each:
-Esp8266: is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip, with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability
-Neo-6M-GPS module: is a well-performing complete GPS receiver with a built-in 25 x 25 x 4mm ceramic antenna, which provides a strong satellite search capability. With the power and signal indicators, you can monitor the status of the module.
-Breadboard: used for prototyping and building circuits on it.
-Wires: used to set up and configure printed circuit boards.
-USB Wire: used to power the board and upload the program via a Micro USB port.
